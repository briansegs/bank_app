## About the app:
This is the next project on my journey to learn how to transform Figma designs into fully functioning websites, improve my CSS skills, and create modern and responsive React.js websites. I learn best by first studying the material and then doing a few projects to work out what I learned. I feel good with React.js and the BEM method so I added Vite and Tailwindcss to this project. I will have to Leave out The BEM method but I have been interested in learning Tailwindcss for quite some time. I'm also excited to work on more advanced placements of gradients and sections with business stats and testimonials. 

### The skills I learned after completing this project:
- More practice with React functional components and their reusability
- More practice with React file and folder structure
- Using Tailwind CSS
- More practice with Fundamental CSS properties to master flex
- More practice with animations to gradients
- More practice with media queries for satisfactory responsiveness on all devices
  
## Technologies:
This project was bootstrapped with [React + Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Components styled with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Setup:
Clone the project and enter its root directory.

Install **Node.js** -> [Instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs)

### `npm i`
Installs all of the project's dependencies.

### `npm run dev`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5173/bank_app/](http://localhost:5173/bank_app/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Approach:
After finding the design I created a basic React + Vite app and set up the file structure. Next, I added some basic styles to my CSS file that I knew I would be resuing. After that, I built each section in the order they appear on the website, tweaking their responsiveness as I went. Lastly, I added features like a return-to-top button that wasn't in the original design. 

## Status:
This project is finished.
